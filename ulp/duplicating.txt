How to duplicate modules in Eagle easily:

Preliminary:
============

1- unzip, copy the script files to the default script directory
   (normally "c:\\Program Files\\eagle-4.11\\scr\\"), copy the
   ulp files to the ulp default directory ( normally
    "c:\\Program Files\\eagle-4.11\\ulp\\")



Duplicating:
============

1- Close the board, leave the schematic open:
   with the mouse, locate the two corners of the bloc to be copied,
   open "duplicate_schematic.ulp" with a text editor and change the
   coordinates x,y of corner_down_left and corner_up_right as
   required. change also the others paramreters: nbr_modules,
   offsetx, offsety, deltay, scr_path and the names of common signals.

2- Launch the script: duplicate_schematic.scr (it will run the above
   ulp and the script generated automatically in one single step).
   you should see the new modules copied.

3- Save the new schematic, close it, and open the board only

4- Similarly, with the mouse, locate the two corners of the bloc to
   be copied, open "duplicate_board.ulp" with a text editor and
   change the coordinates x,y of corner_down_left and corner_up_right
   as required. change also the others paramreters: nbr_modules,
   offsetx, offsety, deltay, scr_path and the names of common signals.

5- You should have the same nbr_modules in the two ULP.

6- Launch the script: duplicate_board.scr (it will run the above ulp
   and the script generated autiomatically in one single step). You
   should see the new modules duplicated.
   
7- Save the board, that's all. open the schematic, run erc, board
   and schematic should be consistent

8- enjoy!!!
